# chrome-state-app
Save all your tabs and retreive all of them with a click of a button with this chrome extension.

## Why did you make this ?
Imagine doing some deep research for some school work and you are 25 tabs deep, JSTOR, google scholar, Stack Overflow articles everywhere and you need a break. So your friends invite you to play a game of VALORANT but how are you going to find all those tabs again ? Web history could be one way but that is very tedious and unreliable depending on if you have your history synced accross devices, ctrl + shift + T is another option but that lacks so much flexibility and its only capable of retrieving tabs from so far ago. What if you need to find all the articles from a paper you wrote two months ago ? So that is where this extension comes in.

## What does this extension do ?
This extension stores all your tabs of the active window in a batch script and allows you to download them and run them at anytime you want.

## Why did you name it this ?
A single browser window with all its tabs and content can be viewed as the state of that browser window and this extension helps save that state.
